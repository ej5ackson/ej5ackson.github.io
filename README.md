# Hi, Hello Evans Martey Jackson Korley! ��
### �� Dynamic, detail-oriented Cybersecurity Analyst with 10+ years in engineering/cybersecurity. Safeguards infrastructure via advanced configurations, log/network analysis (Wireshark, TCPDump), and incident response (SIEM). Conducts audits aligning with CIA/DAD, improving security and compliance. Engineering background bolsters structured thinking and operational excellence.
- ��️ Cybersecurity specialists identify and analyze threats, manage security systems, find vulnerabilities, create policies, respond to incidents, train users, ensure compliance, monitor activity, and secure data.
- �� Threat Intelligence: Understanding and analyzing current and emerging threats.Vulnerability Assessment: Identifying weaknesses in systems and networks.Incident Response: Handling and mitigating security breaches.
Security Monitoring: Watching for suspicious activity using various tools.Log Analysis: Examining system logs for security events.Network Security: Securing network infrastructure and traffic.Endpoint Security: Protecting individual devices (computers, servers).Firewalls: Implementing and managing network security devices.Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Detecting and blocking malicious activity.Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Centralized logging and analysis.Risk Management: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks.Compliance: Understanding and adhering to security regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).Security Awareness Training: Educating users on security best practices.Cryptography: Understanding encryption and secure communication.
Security Operations Center (SOC): Working in a security monitoring and response environment.
- �� My main passionate meaningful purpose of this work, as a cybersecurity analyst as it directly contributes to protecting individuals' financial security and personal information, providing a strong sense of fulfillment and positive impact.
### �� My recent cybersecurity capstone project cantered on the comprehensive development of a robust network defence system. This hands-on project involved the strategic integration of several industry-standard tools to create a multi-layered security posture.
Project featured:
•	pfSense as the firewall: Acting as the primary network defence barrier.
•	Ubuntu servers for centralized logging and SIEM integration: Serving as the hub for collecting and processing security event data.
•	Wazuh for endpoint monitoring and anomaly detection: Providing visibility and security analysis on individual devices.
•	Wireshark for in-depth packet inspection and traffic analysis: Enabling detailed examination of network communications.
•	Simulation of diverse attacks using Kali Linux: Testing the network's defences against realistic threats.
•	Specifically, I utilized pfSense to serve as the network's firewall, controlling and filtering incoming and outgoing traffic. Ubuntu servers were deployed to act as the central repository for logging data, facilitating the crucial function of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) integration.

•	Snort is a security engine utilized to runs on pfSense (as a package) to provide advanced intrusion detection and prevention capabilities by analyzing network traffic against a set of rules.

•	For endpoint monitoring and anomaly detection, I implemented Wazuh, a powerful open-source security platform. This allowed me to gain visibility into the activity on individual devices within the network and identify unusual or suspicious behaviour.

•	To enable in-depth examination of network communications, I utilized Wireshark for packet inspection and traffic analysis. This tool provided granular insights into the data flowing across the network, aiding in understanding normal behaviour and identifying potential threats.

•	To rigorously evaluate the resilience of the constructed defence system, I conducted simulations of diverse attacks using Kali Linux. These simulated attacks included common tactics such as brute force attempts, port scanning, and malware injection, allowing me to test the system's ability to detect and potentially block these threats.
I emphasize that this practical project not only deepened my understanding of security architecture principles but also reinforced the critical importance of proactive surveillance and implementing multi-layered defences to effectively protect a network. I now eager to apply these acquired competencies in a professional cybersecurity role to help organizations anticipate and mitigate emerging risks.
